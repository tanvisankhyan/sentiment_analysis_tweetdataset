The dataset presents a total of 522,886 Tweet IDs of the same number of Tweets about the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant posted on Twitter since the first detected case of this variant on November 24, 2021.

The Tweet IDs are presented in 7 different .txt files based on the timelines of the associated tweets. The following provides the details of these dataset files. The data collection followed a keyword-based approach and tweets comprising the "omicron" keyword were filtered, collected, and added to this dataset.
